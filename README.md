# Math Artwork

This project is an Android Studio application written in C (wrapped in Java of course) that attempts to create work similar to Karl Simm's 'Evolution of Computer Graphics' - https://www.karlsims.com/papers/siggraph91.html.

Various mathematical functions act as tokens in an expression tree, and are able to mutate randomly to create new artpieces. There is currently no user-selection such as the one presented in Karl Simm's work, and therefore no genetic algorithm working behind the scenes to cross highly favored art. Psuedo-random generated art still ends up looking pretty nice!
